This an official RVOS project in ISRC@ISCAS. 

We try to build a Linux-based and/or FreeRTOS-based operating systems for 
processors or accelerators with RISC-V architecture.

The dedicated OS will contains kernel and toolchains, as well as sample 
applications to demostrate a basic/typical solutions for chip vendors.

Todo with priorities

- Linux toolchains 
- Android stack
